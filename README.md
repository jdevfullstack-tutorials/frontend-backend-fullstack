# Frontend VS Backend VS Fullstack
It all started as one just like what Mark Zuckerberg
did in his platform Facebook but nowadays its getting
bigger and bigger, more sophisticated technologies.

## What You Should Know
Well, it ended up into several subfields that now
you can simply focus on one. But of course, you must
understand everything here, like sometimes,
others will start a debate which one is better than
the other. It's just like you are comparing two
unrelated things.

Remember, in the end, it's just programming. 
The only difference is that you are just having
focus on one or two, because software development
nowadays is already a very comprehensive field.

And it's very important to understand this:

## Frontend
The technologies that comprise frontend are
technologies that reside on the browser.

Remember too that a browser is a program,
much like anything that runs on your local
computer, but is, of course, have the full
Internet functions. It's communicating
in terms of the four GET, POST, DELETE, UPDATE
status of HTTP. If you are interested to see
that, you can check out my program:

So, JavaScript and all technologies that
is mainly for the browser is considered frontend.

## Backend
If your code is directly talking to a server
or directly manipulates a database, that is 
considered backend. It resides on the server
side.

When a page is requested, say, a PHP code
is in charge of outputting the HTML,
the page that a user will be seeing is the 
end product of PHP, but the PHP, as the 
script resides at the server-side,
doing things to output the requested HTML.

But why do we need to code in PHP if
the end result is simply an HTML? 
Why not simply write directly the HTML?

If your site is simply static, well, you can
do that. But if your website is just like
an app, then you need to have a script
to automate things for you. The script
will do the job that otherwise you would
do manually.

## Full Stack
So, combining things together, if a 
developer is talented enough to handle
both server-side and browser-side, he
can claim that he is a Full Stack developer,
much like Mark Zuckerberg when he built
his Facebook in the early days of this platform.
