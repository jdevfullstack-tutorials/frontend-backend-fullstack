did in his platform Facebook but nowadays its getting
bigger and bigger, more sophisticated technologies.

## What You Should Know
Well, it ended up into several subfields that now
you can simply focus on one. But of course, you must
understand everything here, like sometimes,
others will start a debate which one is better than
the other. It's just like you are comparing two
unrelated things.

Remember, in the end, it's just programming. 
The only difference is that you are just having
focus on one or two, because software development
nowadays is already a very comprehensive field.

computer, but is, of course, have the full
Internet functions. It's communicating
in terms of the four GET, POST, DELETE, UPDATE
status of HTTP. If you are interested to see

is mainly for the browser is considered frontend.
