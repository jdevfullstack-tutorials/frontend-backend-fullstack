# Front End vs Back End vs Full Stack
Calm down! It all started as one just like 
what Mark Zuckerberg did in his platform Facebook.
But nowadays it's getting
bigger and bigger, more sophisticated technologies.

## What You Should Know
Well, it ended up into several subfields.
Nowadays, they are too immense that
you can simply focus on one. But of course, you must
understand everything here, which is which.
For example, others will start a debate
which is the best framework or scripting
language. But if you have the full knowledge, 
you would say, it's just like you are comparing two
unrelated things.

Remember, in the end, it's just programming. 
Again, the only difference is 
that you are just having
focus on one or two, because software development
nowadays is already a very comprehensive field.
The reason why there are several frameworks,
for example, and several programming
languages, is to solve several problems
in development, so even if it seems they
are the same, they are not. Those that
gain popularity mostly are the very
practical ones, so they are being used
by developers.

And it's very important to understand this:

Programming languages are considered
high-level because it is not close
to the machine language. It is just like
the computer and the programmer meets
halfway. Of course, the programmer
would find it difficult to program
at low level and the machine
would not understand the human language.
So, it's halfway. The job of
any compiler is to translate everything
so that the computer can follow 
the instructions of the programmer.

A browser is an app
that is programmed to run on your local
computer. So, it adds another layer.
Whether you are running any script, be
it server-side or browser-side, it
runs on top of the browser. If not, that
will be a security issue just
like the Java app container.

In the field of software development,
we tend to work on abstraction by 
adding another layer just like the 
image above. Even nowadays, there is
the current trend of no-code & low-code
software dev, so that would
be another level of abstraction. 

But it's all bytes being
transferred to another machine in the 
end. What we see is an outputted
result, not 0s and 1s (representation
of electric pulse).

And finally, if you never heard
of computer network programming,
it's worth learning the basics
even if this is not your interest.
It will give you the full understanding
of all the things that we have now.

### A Little Bit Of The Past ...
But again, to make the long story
short, computers are communicating
with one another. This started
through the network
being used by soldiers during
the Cold War: the ARPANet. It was
made accessible to the public later on.
How computers 
communicate would depend on the protocol.

Back then, we had File Transfer Protocol
(and other protocols).
Instead of wanting less, we wanted more,
so that information could be accessible
to all with less hassle. (Take note,
even sending emails successfully
back then was for the computer
science students.) It was the
World Wide Web that changed the world
forever. The World Wide Web by Tim
Berners Lee sparked the almost-endless
capability of computer networking.
By finding a way to display information
just like a site, not through
upload and download of FTP, he simplified
things that would be otherwise unappealing
to the common public: we interact through
buttons, images, not like the console.
(The World Wide Web is using the HyperText
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When we say
protocol, it's how data will be interpreted).
And then, we still wanted more: a dynamic
website. And as you know, what we have
today is a very sophisticated system
and different technologies working together
to achieve such.

If you are interested learning the hardcore,
you want to read some of this information
from the two leading organizations,
the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
Surely, that's not for the general population.
It's mostly for computer scientists and
hardcore developers but simply knowing it
is worth it.

## Front-End Dev
The technologies that comprise frontend are
technologies that reside on the browser.

Remember too that a browser is a program,
much like anything that runs on your local
computer but, of course, have the full
Internet functions, even WebDAV and FTP
most of the time. It's communicating
in terms of the four GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
and PATCH verbs of HTTP
(HyperText Transfer Protocol is a very
interesting topic in network programming).
If you are interested to see
that, you can check out my program:

<https://github.com/xdvrx1/lightweight-web-server>

So, for example, JavaScript and all technologies that
are mainly for the browser are considered front-end.
`Vue.js` is considered to be a framework
of JavaScript for web interfaces 
while we can say that `Angular` is for
heavyweight development. 
`Twitter Bootstrap` is mainly for the layout
across multiple devices. 

## Back-End Dev
If your code is directly talking to a server
or directly manipulates a database, that is 
considered back-end. It resides on the server
side.

When a page is requested, say, a PHP code
is in charge of outputting the HTML,
the page that a user will be seeing is the 
end product of PHP, but the PHP, as the 
script resides at the server-side,
doing things to output the requested HTML.

But why do we need to code in PHP if
the end result is simply an HTML? 
Why not simply write directly the HTML?

If your site is simply static, well, you can
do that. But if your website is just like
an app, then you need to have a script
to automate things for you. The script
will do the job that otherwise you would
do manually.

## Full-Stack Dev
So, combining things together, if a 
developer is talented enough to handle
both server-side and browser-side, he
can claim that he is a Full Stack developer,
much like Mark Zuckerberg when he built
his Facebook in the early days of this platform.

## About HTML
It is very important to mention HTML
because it's the endpoint of all development.
Others consider HTML as a programming language.

Take note, IT IS NOT A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.
Rather, it is a markup language. 

HTML came from SGML (Standardized Generalized
Markup Language) and SGML is also
a markup language. You can also call a markup
language a metalanguage. 
It deals with annotation.
Think of it just like the practice
back then when a writer submitted his
written work so that it could be published.
The writer would leave his/her annotations so that
when printed, it would be
exactly the writer wanted it.  

## So The Next Time ...
So the next time you encounter these terms
you would not be in awe just like
when you don't have the idea yet. They
are just programmers (with, of course,
different focus) in the end.
